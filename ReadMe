****Note for Tagging in brain-view2:
***************************************************************************

The loaded tag files from previous steps are always in blue and size 0.05 => this size will give you a good sense of tag size as well

Choose tag size of your preference before creating tags. Once the tag is created, you cannot change its size.

"Create Tag" only show it in the scene graph. If you are happy with the selected tag, you should "Add Tag" to actually add the tag to the list.

You need to "Add Tag" right after "Create Tag" if you want to save it. Once a new tag is created, the previous created tag cannot be added.

Don't worry about adding a single tag more than once, it will not be saved in the output file more than once!

When you are "Saving Tag file", tag file will be erased and all the tags you added to the list in the current run of the program will be copied to the file. So you can save your file anytime and as many times as you want during one run of the program and have all of the tags you have picked so far saved. This is for the convenience to not loose your work, after say 10 minutes of tagging, if the program crashes.
